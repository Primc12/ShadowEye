DESC
The projects shadow eye consits of self powering camera. The camera is powered with solar power,
and it can rotate up to 180 degrees using servo. The arduino board controls when camera power on
and camera automacally takes a photo and then starts livestream. For battery saving and memory 
on sd card camera takes 9 pictures a day, at 3 different times: 7 15 20 and timelapse. When the time hits 15:00
the camera will also start livestream which will last 1h. When livestream happens servo will slowly rotate 
180 degrees. 

POWER
We have two 5W solar panels each on one side. The are connected in series and then in parrael to give 5 volts.
The 5V will go through buck converter to give regulated output voltage and boost 5V to 7.4. The two lithum
cells in series will charge and then the power wil go trough transistor into camera. Arduino will also work 
with 7.4V, it will be powering the base of transistor and controling servo, leds.

ACHIEVEMENTS
I will be able to see around the house and get epic shots and timelapses. The project can be future expanded with 
radio transmiting networks itd... I will see how long the components last and I will see the time.

MATERIALS
We will be using: Wood (foudation), Plastic (waterproofing), Cardboard (construction), Sticks (construction).
